Notes:

#docker
#github will tell you when it can't merge things
    #you have to resolve manually
#VSC has a merge contradiction editor

#Rebasing from main (put in changes as they occurred chronologically)
    #Merge main into your branch consistently is the smartest thing to do

#Create new branch: git branch develop 
#Can just use publish branch, or 

#git pull before pushing every time

#make branch of branch with: 
#   git checkout branch1
#   git checkout -b name_of_branch_of_branch1

#Use linters to automatically check your coding conventions 

#testing -> make sure code does the same thing regardless of the changes you make
    #replicate known result and input

#In test_models.py
    #Use functions so that you can run multiple tests (without functions, it stops after first error)

#Use some smart package
    #Eg pytest will run all functions that start with <test>

#Code coverage -> want to test a large amount of the code
    Can compute code coverage
