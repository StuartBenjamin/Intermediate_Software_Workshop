Notes:

#docker
#github will tell you when it can't merge things
    #you have to resolve manually
#VSC has a merge contradiction editor

#Rebasing from main (put in changes as they occurred chronologically)
    #Merge main into your branch consistently is the smartest thing to do

#Create new branch: git branch develop 
#Can just use publish branch, or 

#git pull before pushing every time

#make branch of branch with: 
#   git checkout branch1
#   git checkout -b name_of_branch_of_branch1

#Use linters to automatically check your coding conventions
